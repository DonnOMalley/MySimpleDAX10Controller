* Description:                                                    *
*   - Sketch for the Arduino + Ethernet shield + X10Firecracker.  *
*     The DAX10Gateway provides a simple webserver on ports 80    *
*     And 8080 for supporting a simple browser interface as well  *
*     As a more feature-rich Android client. The HTTP requests    *
*     Are parsed and converted to X10 Firecracker Commands. These *
*     Commands are sent out via digital pins and the X10          *
*     Firecracker sends out the X10 commands via RF               *
*                                                                 *
* Requirements:                                                   *
*   - X10Firecracker (Hardware and Arduino Library)               *
*   - Arduino Ethernet shield                                     *
*                                                                 *
